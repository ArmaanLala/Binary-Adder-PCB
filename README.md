The figure above shows a schematic of the Binary Adder circuit. 
Layout summary:
- The power jack on the opposing side and thus out of the way of the user.

The figure above shows a board view implementing the above schematic. 

Layout summary:
- The power jack on the opposing side and thus out of the way of the user. 
- The user selects the input A and B on the side nearest to the user.
- The 4008N in between input switches and out LEDs.
- The LEDs near the opp.
